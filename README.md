# Remote Telegram shell
> This is a program that uses Telegram to interact with a remote machine executing any command. You **don't need** the ip address of the machine you want to connect to.

## Prerequisites
* [Get a Telegram Bot and a Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
* Python 3
* pip3

## Installation
Once you have the token and the id of the chat you want to use to interact with the bot

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrihacar/remote-telegram-shell.git
```
Copy the file configuration file to the path specified in the script
```bash
cd remote-telegram-shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/telegram-shell && cp ./telegram-shell-conf.json $HOME/.config/telegram-shell
```

Fill the configuration file with the TOKEN and the CHAT ID
CHAT ID can be empty, it is not required if you want the program to be executed from more than one chat
```
{
"TOKEN":"",
"CHAT_ID":""
}
```

Install all the dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run this script in background and redirect the standard output
```bash
./telegram_shell.py  >/dev/null &
```
Open your telegram conversation and enjoy :)
